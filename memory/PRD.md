# Coco AI — PRD / Working Notes

## Original problem statement
Clone public repo `https://github.com/alifnewone7-create/ccccc-run.git` into /app and run it
unchanged. Subsequent requests refine the existing Next.js app ("Coco AI" trading analyzer).
User writes in Banglish (Bengali in Latin script) — respond accordingly.

## Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 16 (App Router) at /app/frontend, production build served by `yarn start`
  via supervisor on port 3000. Every code change requires `yarn build` + `supervisorctl restart frontend`.
- Backend: FastAPI proxy at /app/backend (port 8001), unused for app logic.
- Data/AI: Firebase Auth + Realtime Database (keys hardcoded in repo), Groq AI SDK.
- Install deps with `yarn install --ignore-engines` (Node 20 vs @ai-sdk/groq requiring 22).

## Implemented (June 2026 session)- Cloned repo, built and ran the app.
- Removed "Operator profile" text from dashboard profile.
- Admin route renamed `/secret-portal-sx` → `/coco-private-island`; credentials
  (username/password/secret key) all set to `iamhear` in `lib/server/admin-auth.ts`.
- Dashboard "Access tier" section: removed tier list (Free/Basic/Standard/Premium) and the
  big per-day number; only Current plan + "Resets daily" remain. Plan card is now a flat
  full-width strip above the Daily quota card on desktop; quota tools in 4 columns.
- Profile card: uses uploaded Coco AI logo (`/public/coco-profile.png`), tighter mobile gap
  with a small glowing divider under the avatar, Operator ID + Member since cards removed,
  email masked by default with show/hide (eye) + copy buttons.
- Admin panel "API key" tab: add/pause/delete multiple Groq API keys, stored in Firebase RTDB
  at `usage/__config/groqKeys` (that branch is already writable by the internal admin identity,
  so no Firebase rule publish is needed; `config` path rule also added to
  firebase-database-rules.json for reference). `/api/analyze` loads active keys from DB at
  request time and fails over key-by-key on 429/auth errors; built-in keys used as fallback
  when the DB list is empty.

## Key files
- `components/dashboard/dash-profile.tsx`, `components/dashboard/dash-tier.tsx`
- `components/admin/admin-dashboard.tsx` (GroqKeysPanel at end of file)
- `app/api/admin/groq-keys/route.ts`, `lib/server/groq-keys.ts`
- `lib/server/admin-auth.ts`, `lib/server/firebase-admin.ts`, `app/api/analyze/route.ts`

## Backlog
### Analyzer bug fix (15 Sep 2026 run) — VERIFIED by testing agent (iteration_1.json)
- Root cause of "Failed to analyze the chart": MODEL_ID was `qwen/qwen3.6-27b`, which returns
  404 model_not_found on the new Groq account (`coco-ai-c363d` project's key). Fixed to
  `qwen/qwen3.8-27b` (only vision model on that account). Verified 200 analysis end-to-end.
- Added: capacity (503 "over capacity") detection with 3 retries + backoff per key, clearer
  error messages (503 capacity / 502 model unavailable / 422 unreadable chart / 503 no key
  configured), and `refundCredit()` so a failed run does not burn a daily credit.
- Removed dead hardcoded FALLBACK_KEYS (both returned 401); keys now come only from the DB.
- Firebase switched to project `coco-ai-c363d` (client + server) and internal admin identity
  renamed to `portal-admin@coco-ai.internal`; rules file updated (publish in console for
  strict rules). Admin sidebar branding changed Sweetex AI → Coco AI with the Coco logo.
- Note: Standard tier daily limit is 35/tool (lib/tiers.ts), not 50.
- P1: Usage history chart for users; upgrade nudge when quota nearly used.
- P2: Admin activity log; per-key usage stats in the API key panel.

### Result card redesign (16 Sep 2026) — VERIFIED (iteration_5.json)
- New `components/analysis-result.tsx` (AnalysisResultCard + redesigned details popup) and
  `components/result-glyphs.tsx` (custom animated SVG glyphs); styles in `app/analysis-result.css`
  (imported in layout.tsx after coco.css so `.ar-*` borders override `.coco *` white hairline).
- Layout: pair header + OTC/REAL pill → CALL/PUT hero (spinning medallion, sweep, bar cluster on
  desktop) → confidence ring + support/resistance price ladder side-by-side → trend/pattern chips →
  "Analysis details" CTA. Popup: accent-rail sections, indicator badges, gradient score bars.
- All borders violet/tone-tinted (no white). No backdrop-filter / heavy glow on <640px.
- Old ResultBlock/StatTile/lux-beacon markup removed from chart-analyzer.tsx (lux-beacon CSS still
  in globals.css, unused).
- Still pending from earlier: apply CocoPageShell design to /login, /registration, /dashboard, /privacy.
